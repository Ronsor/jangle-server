The Jangle Server Core

(C) 2019-2020 Ronsor Labs.

This version partially handles Discord gateway level `v6` and REST API level `v6` and `v7`.

Jangle was originally intended to be a competitor to Discord, but the project was dropped. This code
is provided in the hopes that it'll be useful to someone, somehow.

#### General TODO

1. ToAPI() *can* fail sometimes. We don't ever report this.

#### Setup

TODO: Finish this

Requires a MongoDB 3.6+ instance. It must be part of a replica set.
